							<h1 align="center">PARIKSHIT SHINGE</h1>
							<p align="justify">Hi! I'm a data professional who's been building data-intensive scalable applications for almost 7 years now. 
								I'm good at machine learning, data mining and analysis, data visualization, data engineering, web and app analytics implementation, and workflow automation. 
								I use various tools and technology platforms to get things done. I'm have expertise in SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Keras), Tableau, Microsoft SSIS, Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, Git etc. 
								By formal education, I'm an engineer. I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering (Information Technology) from Shivaji University, India in 2016.
								<br><br>

								When I'm not busy being a data nerd, you can find me exploring new places, capturing life's moments through my camera lens, or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. 
								I love travelling solo and have been to 6 countries in South East Asia. I believe that staying curious and pursuing diverse interests is key to fueling creativity and staying on top of your game!<br><br>

								Currently, I'm based in Singapore where I'm enjoying the vibrant culture and bustling city life.  
								If you are based in Singapore too, lets catch up for a cup of coffee. Thanks! <br>
